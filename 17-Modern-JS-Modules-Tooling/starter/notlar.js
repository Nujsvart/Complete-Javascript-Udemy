//! An Overview of Modules in JavaScript

//? Module: Reusable piece of code that encapsulates implementation details.

//? IMPORT (Dependency) // EXPORT (Public API)

//* Why Modules?

//? Compose Software: Modules are small building blocks that we put together to build complex applications

//? Isolate components: Modules can be developed in isolation without thinking about the entire codebase.

//? Abstract code: Implement low-level code in modules and import these abstractions into other modules.

//? Organized code: Modules naturally lead to a more organized codebase.

//? Reuse code: Modules allow us to easily reuse the same code, even across multiple projects.
